# PRIZMATIC
An API Wrapper for Reddit, Discord, and Matrix [seperate modules, one repo]

# LICENSE
Ok, so here's the deal, I don't want to get into licensing things because I don't want to
get in trouble. So, here is the *very official* license that I just made up:
```
Feel free to do whatever you want with this software. Just do not pass it off as your own.
It is provided "as-is", and all issues sould be reported to this repository. No warranty
or anything is provided, just this, and my willingness to do stuff.
```
Now that we got that out of the way, info on Discord, Reddit, and Matrix

# THIS WRAPPER
This repository is split into 3 submodules:
```
> "discord" - the Discord bit
> "reddit" -- the Reddit bit
> "riot" ---- the Matrix/Riot bit
```
These modules are seperate, but can interact with eachother in the way that you can load
each one into the same file. It's all up to you from there.

# DEPENDENCIES
```
1] py3.5 to py3.7, don't use py3.8 because I can't verify if it works there.
2] Knowledge of code
>  Basically, I will make this module as easy as possible to understand,
>  but you still need to actually make your own code
3] Actually, I'm not too sure yet...
```

# DOCUMENTATION
I don't know how to document stuff... so the best I can say is just look at the code.

When I do document stuff, it will generally follow this syntax:
```
>> DESCRIPTION FOR CLASS/FUNCTION
variable_name [type] - description
```

Also, note these common variable name things:
```
st -- Most likely a `str`
num - Most likely an `int` or `float`
dic - Most likely a `dict`
ls -- Most likely a `list`
tp -- Most likely a `tuple`
```
I use them frequently for small bits of code that aren't too significant

# PRIZMATIC
An API Wrapper for Reddit, Discord, and Matrix [seperate modules, one repo]

# LICENSE
Ok, so here's the deal, I don't want to get into licensing things because I don't want to
get in trouble. So, here is the *very official* license that I just made up:
```
Feel free to do whatever you want with this software. Just do not pass it off as your own.
It is provided "as-is", and all issues sould be reported to this repository. No warranty
or anything is provided, just this, and my willingness to do stuff.
```
Now that we got that out of the way, info on Discord, Reddit, and Matrix

# THIS WRAPPER
This repository is split into 3 submodules:
```
> "discord" - the Discord bit
> "reddit" -- the Reddit bit
> "riot" ---- the Matrix/Riot bit
```
These modules are seperate, but you can interact with them in mostly
the same way if you like. The biggest difference between any of these
modules are the class names.

# DEPENDENCIES
```
1] py3.6 and up, however py3.8 is a mystery zone because I don't use it myself
2] Knowledge of code
>  Basically, I will make this module as easy as possible to understand,
>  but you still need to actually make your own code
```
Install the requirements:
```
Windows   ] C:\>py -m pip install -r req.txt

```
**This is not a package yet. Do not bug me about that.**

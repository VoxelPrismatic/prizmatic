    USAGE ---
        This is not a regular class. It must be used as follows:

                ...
        
        This is a parameter class that forms a list of all consecutive
        arguments that match its class parameter. It is mainly used with
        commands for arguments and things.

        break when an invalid param is passed [when the command is called]. It is
        mainly used with commands for arguments and things.

        This is a parameter class that forms an argument that can have multiple
        forms and will not break as often on a command call. It is mainly used 
        with commands for arguments and things.

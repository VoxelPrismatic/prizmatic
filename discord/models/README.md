# NOTICE
```
In an attempt to make things as clean as possible, every single class will live
in it's own file. As a side effect, there will be many many files and many many
folders  with  classes in them.  I'm  doing  this to make  sure  everything  is
as  organized as possible and  is  logical too. Taking  a  look  at discord.py,
you will see all the  models in the root folder,  making it  clunky and hard to
understand. I will prevent this by having various folders and things seperating
this   module  [and the others]  by   catagory.   Thanks   for   understanding.

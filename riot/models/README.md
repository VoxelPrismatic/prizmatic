# NOTICE
```
I am trying to make this module as clean and as user friendly as possible.
Therefore, I will be organizing these models into seperate folders. However,
this does NOT represent how it should be used in your code. Although the docs
may say otherwise, you should always use `riot.models.[class_name]`
